From 0.9.15 to 0.9.18
- -------------------
- got stable status!(after many tests)
- many code clean up and new classes.
- fixed bug when hiden the last component. You got a warning but the action
  is writen in the gpppkillrc file.
- all dialog are now modal and display as children windows.
- fixed warnings when starting gpppkill with the graph component hiden.
- fixed issue with the 3 configure_events. Now gpppkill don't call 
  gtk_widget_show() for every widget. It use only one gtk_widget_show_all()
- preference window got a clist for chosing a interface
- got statusbar

From 0.9.13 to 0.9.14
- -------------------
- fixed a black pixmap when Linux is at big load.
    Very strange one, when Linux is aumenting the load(i.e. from 1.0 to 2.0)
    the drawing area recive 3 configure_events. The second configure_event
    has the width member (event->width < 0). I use this information to create
    the pixmap, so I get a black pixmap. 
    The issue is that in normal load, the drawing_area only get 2 
    configure_event and neither event->width are < 0.
- thanks to the function 'gdk_window_get_root_origin()' from gdk, the options
    in the ~/.gpppkillrc :
      dxWM
      dyWM
    are no more used. This function return the real position of the window
    with the decoration of the window manager.
- Compile in gtk+ 1.2 with the -DGTK_DISABLE_COMPAT_H option passed to the
    compiler. This means, pure gtk+ 1.2!
- first atempt to write and distribute a changelog in English.
